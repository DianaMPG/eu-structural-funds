# 1. Describe the source metadata:
# -----------------------------
#
# title: a short description of your data source.
#
# language: the 2-digit language code of the document (e.g. en, fr, es...)
#
# sources: only meant as documention: add as many as you want (urls to
#          the actual data-files are in the resources section).
#
# scraper_required: if a web or PDF scraper is needed
#
# contributors: put yourself down (email and website are not obligatory).
#               Follow the simple formatting convention.
#
# resources: a single description file like this can describe more than one
#            resource (file or webpage) as long as the data is structured the
#            same. This happens when the data is split by fund or period for
#            example.
#
# Good luck!

  # 2. Describe each data-resource:
  # ----------------------------
  #
  # title: use this field to distinguish the resources if there's more than one
  #
  # url: the link to the file if possible. If the data needs to be scraped,
  #      enter the url of the webpage and set scraper_required to true.
  #
  # publication_date: the date that the data was published or updated
  #
  # constant_fields: any field from fiscal.fields.yaml that has a fixed value
  #                  (i.e. is not specified row by row).
  #
  # schema: please describe each column in the data. Don't change the original
  #         columns names even in Cyrillic. For translations, Google will do.
  #         Refer to fiscal.fields.yaml to discover what fiscal field map to
  #         the columns that you found. If you can't tell, enter a short comment
  #         instead. Leave the mapping blank if the column can be dropped.

  # Good luck!
