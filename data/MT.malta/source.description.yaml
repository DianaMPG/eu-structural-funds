    - description: 'e.g. OPIIPA2 Continuous training and education. This field looks
        like a concatenation of Operational Programme II and Priority Axis 2. It''s
        unclear what Operational Programme II refers to since there is only one Operational
        Programme listed for Malta for the period 2007-2013. Also the description
        after the code cannot be cross reference to any other description. So this
        field is not mapped.
