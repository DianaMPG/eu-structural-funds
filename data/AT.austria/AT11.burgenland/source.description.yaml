# resources: a single source can have one or more data-files, called
#            "resources". Why? Because there may be regular data updates or
#            the data may be broken down by funds for example.

title: ERDF data for Burgenland (AT) 2007-

description: Burgenland is a region in Astria that has its own ESIF program called 'phasing out'. Phasing out has a total volume of 444 million €, 177 of which are proided approximately 70% by ERDF and 30% by ESF. 153 million are co-fiananced by the Republic of Austria and 144 are provided by the Burgenland itself. Therefore, there are two datasets to consider here (ESF contributions to 'Phasing Out' and ERDF contributions to 'Phasing Out').

  # Describe each data-file:
  # ------------------------
  #
  # title: a short description of the data file
  #
  # url: the link to the file if possible. If the data needs to be scraped,
  #      leave this property blank and set the "extraction_mode" to
  #      "web_scraper".
  #
  # path: leave blank if there's a url link to the data-file. If there's no
  #       link to the file but you can download it by clicking through
  #       a user-interface, then do so and then specify its path here.
  #       The path is the *relative path* (starting from this file). So if you
  #       put the data-file in the same folder, it's just the filename.
  #
  # publication_date: the date that the data was published
  #
  # publication_version: should clearly distinguish this data-file from others.
  #
  # periods: the "official" fiscal periods that the data-file covers.
  #
  # extraction_mode: set one of the options to "true" and the rest to "false"
  #
  # constants: Some of the fields we're trying to collect may be constant. Take
  #            the currency for example: it may not be mentioned in the data
  #            because it's common to all rows. Identify as many constants as
  #            you can.
  #
  # fields: the columns in the data table. Describe them as best you can.
  #
  # Good luck!
