## Pipeline architeture

### Philosophy

The data pipeline is a fine blend of manual and automated processing. We try to adhere to the following principles:

- Good communication between 
- Automize the pipeline as much as possible but avoid over-engineering automation 
- Use [Frictionless-Data](http://www.frictionlessdata.io/) standards wherever possible

### What humans do
