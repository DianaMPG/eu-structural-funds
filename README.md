# EU Subsidies Data

Subsidystories.eu intends to increase transparency of EU-Funds by unravelling how the European Structural Investment Funds are spent. We collected and standardised all available beneficiary lists for the ERDF, ESF and CF for the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 funding periods. These funds are partially funded by the EU and the Member States and allocated by regional authorities to local beneficiaries [policy]( . Find out who has received funding in your country.

## Project overview

Structural and Cohesion Funds are financial tools set up to implement the regional policy of the European Union. They aim to reduce regional disparities in income, wealth and opportunities. The overall budget for the 2007-2013 period was __â‚¬347 billion__ [according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_Funds_and_Cohesion_Fund). 

This project is a collaborative effort between [Open-Knowledge Germany](https://www.okfn.de/en/), [Open-Knowledge International](http://okfn.org/) and a number of citizens, journalists and developers. You can join us on our public [Slack channel](https://alleusubsidydata.slack.com/messages/general/).

This repository is a __data pipeline__. It channels beneficiary data from various national or regional sources into the [Open-Spending](http:next.openspending.org) datastore. The goal is to provide a unified european dataset for all subsidies funds for at least two funding periods: 2007-3013 and 2014-2020.

## What's in the repository?

The repository contains the following:

- `codelists/`: codelist information (fields of type *category*) 
- `common/`: python code, including reusable project-wide pipeline processors
