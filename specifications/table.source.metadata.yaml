# Describe the source that you found.
# -----------------------------------
#
# A data source can have one or more data-files. Please make sure that each
# of these files has a corresponding "filename.source.schema.yaml" descriptor.
#
# The "description" property is the place to put your notes. Warnings, remarks
# and limitations about the data are especially important to communicate.
#
# The property "sources" is meant as documention. Add as many as you want.
# The image will be used to illustrate the data source on the website. Check
# its license. Put yourself down as a contributor (email and website are not
# obligatory). You can use a nickname.
