# Describe the source that you found.
# -----------------------------------
#
# A data source can have one or more data-files. Please make sure that each
# of these files has a corresponding "filename.source.schema.yaml" descriptor.
#
# The "description" property is the place to put your notes. Warnings, remarks
# and limitations about the data are especially important to communicate.
#
# The property "sources" is meant as documention. Add as many as you want.
# The image will be used to illustrate the data source on the website. Check
# its license. Put yourself down as a contributor (email and website are not
# obligatory). You can use a nickname.

  # Describe the data table in the file that you sourced.
  # -----------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Rename this file as "name of the downloaded file.source.data.extension". An
  # example is "beguenstigtenverzeichnis2015_final.source.data.pdf". If there's
  # nothing you can download, then invent a name. Spaces are okay.
  #
  # You can have as many fields as you want. Describe them as best you can.
  #
  # The "path" is the relative path. Basically, it's just the filename if you
  # downloaded the file in the same directory. If downloading was impossible,
  # then ignore the path and just specify the "url". The data will be scraped by
  # someone else.
  #
  # The "publication_date" is the date of the last data update on the website.
  #
  # Last, "global_fields" are fields whose value is the same for all rows in the
  # data, like "currency". They are often omitted in the data table but specified
  # somewhere else. Please make sure that you fill in as many as you can.
  #
  # Good luck!
